A program is a sequence of mathematical instruction which are written by a human and executed by a computer.
The VHDL langage has been created to describe digital and signals systems such as field-programmable gate arrays
and integrated circuits\cite{wiki-vhdl}. The problem is that VHDL is an old, verbose and tricky language.

SpinalHDL has been created to fight thos disadvantage. The main goal of a DSL (Domain Specific Langage) is to offer a more plaisant way to code and that's what dose SpinalHDL. Has written before, the code is written by a human and by using SpinalHDL, the human became happier than using just the VHDL.

KlugHDL is an another tools to make the human happiest, it's a component diagram generator which offer some

SpinalHDL is a programming language to describe digital hardware and generate the corresponding in VHDL (or Verilog). SpinalHDL is written in Scala as a DSL and has multiple advantages\cite{github-spinalhdl} :
\begin{itemize}
    \item No restriction to the genericity of your hardware description by using Scala constructs
    \item No more endless wiring. Create and connect complex buses like AXI in one line.
    \item Evolving capabilities. Create your own buses definition and abstraction layer.
    \item Reduce code size by a high factor, especially for wiring. Allowing you to have a better visibility, more productivity and fewer headaches.
    \item Free and user friendly IDE. Thanks to scala world for auto-completion, error highlight, navigation shortcut and many others
    \item Extract information from your digital design and then generate files that contain information about some latency and addresses
    \item Bidirectional translation between any data type and bits. Useful to load a complex data structure from a CPU interface.
    \item Check for you that there is no combinational loop / latch
    \item Check that there is no unintentional cross clock domain 
\end{itemize}

The code \ref{lst:spinalhdl_example_and_gate} shows a AND gate written with SpinalHDL with the corresponding generated VHDL code, we could see the similarity between the two code.

\section{Goal} %{{{
\label{sec:Goal}

The goal of the project is to produce an application which is analysing a spinalhdl program in order to produce a block diagramm of the corresponding hardware description. This application should offer the following activities :

\begin{itemize}
    \item Display the complete graph of the programm
    \item Navigate through all the hierarchical level of the programm (Component inside another component)
    \item The edges should display some information about the signals :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item type
        \item input or output
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
    \item A Hierarchical view (like in filesystems or in Quartus)
    \item A filter functionnality in order to view only some specific component
\end{itemize}

The application is going to be develop, firstable, in a standalone version and next could be develop into a plugin version for Eclipse or IntelliJ.
