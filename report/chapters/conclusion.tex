This project tries to offer an additional tool for SpinalHDL in order to
increase his popularity. Domain specific languages are more and more used in
computer software this days and KlugHDL could be describe as a tool for
development and documentation.

Writing VHDL code over and over again seems to be painful and SpinalHDL try to
make the developer life easier, but VHDL owns a lot of tools to increase
productivity. KlugHDL is the first ``tool'' of the whole world of SpinalHDL and
launch a new era for SpinalHDL and his believer.

KlugHDL is able to parse and generate static diagrams with DOT and Graphviz for
any simple SpinalHDL components. Components with bus or complex basetype, like
$Uint(n bits)$ aren't supported for the moments. KlugHDL is also here to
demonstrate it's possible to generate diagrams from the SpinalHDL AST.

We have seen that parsing the AST could be tricky and sometimes really strange.
We need additionnal SpinalHDL Components and a lot deeper understanding of the
SpinalHDL AST in order to parse and generate all the possible components which
could be written.
