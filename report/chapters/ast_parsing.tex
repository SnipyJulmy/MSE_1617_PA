\chapter{Parsing the AST}
\label{chap:parsing-ast}

The abstract syntax tree of SpinalHDL is the core components of all the KlugHDL
product. He is used to produce the intermediate representation in the generation
pipeline (figure \ref{fig:generation-pipeline}) and once the intermediate
representation is built, the rest is easely makable.

The concept of AST as already been explain in chapter \ref{sub:Abstract Syntax
  Tree}. Using this, we are going to see the parsing of the SpinalHDL AST in
order to generate an intermediate model. The parsing and the following
generation into the intermediate model is separate in multiple
phases :

\begin{itemize}
\item Diagram parsing
\item Components parsing
\item Ports parsing
\item Connections parsing
\end{itemize}

As illustrate in the intermediate model class diagram
\ref{fig:model-class-diagram}, the intermediate representation is composed like
the following :
\begin{itemize}
\item A model possesses multiple diagrams (at least two : the toplevel and the
  root component)
\item A diagrams possesses at least one component with zero or more ports
\item A diagrams possesses zero or more connections which are 
\end{itemize}
